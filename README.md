# Cognitive Model: A Forward Diagnostic Framework for Number-Theoretic Distortion

## Overview

This repository presents a theoretical and computational framework for analyzing discrete integer sequences through a geometry-inspired "curvature" model. By drawing a pedagogical analogy to relativistic distortions, we define a **forward diagnostic map** that highlights structural irregularities—especially those arising from divisor density. This model is intended for **structural analysis**, not for blind inversion of unknown values.

## Key Concepts

1. **Curvature Function**

   $$
   \kappa(n) = \frac{d(n) \cdot \ln(n)}{e^2}
   $$

   * **d(n)**: Divisor count of $n$ (i.e., $\sigma_0(n)$).
   * **ln(n)**: Natural logarithm of $n$.
   * **Normalization**: Constant $e^2$ determined empirically.
   * **Interpretation**: Higher divisor counts and larger values yield greater local "curvature".

2. **Distortion Mapping (Forward Model)**

   $$
   \Delta_n = v \cdot \kappa(n)
   $$

   * **v**: A user-defined "traversal rate" parameter (e.g., cognition or iteration speed).
   * **$\Delta_n$**: Modeled distortion at $n$.
   * **Purpose**: Encodes how rapid progression through integers skews apparent structure.

3. **Perceived Value**

   $$
   n_{\text{perceived}} = n \times \exp\bigl(\Delta_n\bigr)
   $$

   * Applies exponential scaling to the true integer based on $\Delta_n$.
   * Emphasizes how distortion amplifies structural irregularities in composites.

4. **Z-Transformation (Context-Dependent Normalization)**

   $$
   Z(n) \;=\; \frac{n}{\exp\bigl(v \cdot \kappa(n)\bigr)}
   $$

   * **Forward diagnostic use only**: Assumes knowledge of $n$ and $v$ to normalize distortion.
   * **Outcome**: Reveals underlying structural stability, particularly for primes where $\kappa(n)$ is minimal.

## Empirical Validation

* **Prime vs. Composite Curvature (n = 2–49)**

  * Prime average curvature: \~0.739
  * Composite average curvature: \~2.252
  * Ratio: Composites ≈3.05× higher curvature

* **Classification Test**

  * Simple threshold on $\kappa(n)$ yields \~83% accuracy distinguishing primes from composites.

These results demonstrate that primes appear as "minimal-curvature geodesics" within the discrete sequence, providing a quantitative diagnostic measure of number complexity.

## Implementation

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Main Scripts**:

  * `main.py`: Full cognitive model simulation with visualization
  * `curvature_gist.py`: **Self-contained gist** for curvature computation and classification
  * `generate_plots.py`: Generate plots for white paper analysis

### Quick Start with Self-Contained Gist

The `curvature_gist.py` script provides a standalone implementation with **numpy and sympy** as dependencies:

```bash
# Default usage (n = 2-10000, threshold=1.5)
python curvature_gist.py

# Smaller dataset for faster execution
python curvature_gist.py --max-n 1000

# Custom v-parameter for Z-transformation
python curvature_gist.py --max-n 1000 --v-param 0.5

# Custom threshold for classification
python curvature_gist.py --max-n 5000 --threshold 1.0

# Control bootstrap samples
python curvature_gist.py --max-n 10000 --bootstrap-samples 500
```

**Key Features**:
- Instant computation for custom n ranges
- Built-in primality checks and bootstrap CI reporting
- Extensible v-parameter tuning for Z-normalization
- Tunable threshold for classification accuracy
- Outputs `kappas.csv` with κ(n) values
- ~88% classification accuracy for n=2-10000 with threshold=1.5

The gist can also be imported as a module:

```python
import numpy as np
import curvature_gist as cg

# Compute curvature for specific numbers
print(cg.kappa(7))   # Prime: low curvature
print(cg.kappa(12))  # Composite: high curvature

# Batch analysis example
seq = np.arange(2, 1001)
kappas = [cg.kappa(i) for i in seq]
classifications = [cg.classify_by_kappa(i, threshold=1.5) for i in seq]
primes = [cg.is_prime(i) for i in seq]
accuracy = np.mean(np.array(classifications) == np.array(primes))
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

### Full Model Example

```bash
# Run complete cognitive model with visualizations
python main.py
```

Generates curvature statistics, distortion plots, and CSV exports.

## Limitations & Scope

1. **Forward Diagnostic Only**

   * The Z-transformation **requires** known $n$ and rate $v$. It **does not** serve as a standalone inverse to recover unknown integers from perceived values.
2. **Context-Dependent Parameters**

   * Parameters like $v$ (traversal rate) must be set or estimated; values are not inferred solely from data.
3. **Metaphorical Analogy**

   * References to relativity and geodesics are pedagogical. The core mathematics stands independently of physical interpretations.

## Future Directions

* **Parameter Estimation**: Explore data-driven methods to approximate traversal rates from observed distortions.
* **Enhanced Classification**: Integrate curvature features into machine-learning classifiers for primality testing.
* **Theoretical Extensions**: Investigate connections between divisor-based curvature and deeper analytic number theory.
