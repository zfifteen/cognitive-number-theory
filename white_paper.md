## Abstract

This paper presents a novel computational framework for understanding cognitive distortions in mathematical number perception through a geometry-inspired curvature model. By drawing pedagogical analogies to relativistic space-time distortions, we introduce a forward diagnostic mapping that quantifies structural irregularities in discrete integer sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that prime numbers exhibit minimal cognitive curvature, appearing as "geodesics" in the mathematical number space, while composite numbers show significantly higher curvature values. The framework includes empirical validation through machine learning classification experiments and provides both theoretical foundations and practical applications for understanding cognitive mathematical processing.

## 1. Introduction

The perception and processing of mathematical concepts by cognitive systems—whether human or artificial—often involves systematic distortions that reflect underlying structural complexities. Traditional number theory focuses on abstract mathematical properties, but the cognitive experience of working with numbers reveals patterns of difficulty, perception, and processing that suggest a deeper geometric structure to the mathematical landscape.

This paper introduces a computational framework that models cognitive distortions in number perception using a curvature-based approach inspired by differential geometry. Our central hypothesis is that the perceived "difficulty" or "complexity" of mathematical numbers can be quantified through a curvature function that captures local geometric properties of the discrete number sequence.

### 1.1 Motivation

Consider the cognitive experience of working with different numbers: most people find prime numbers like 7, 11, 13 somehow "cleaner" or more fundamental than highly composite numbers like 12, 24, or 60. This intuitive distinction suggests an underlying geometric structure where primes represent minimal-distortion paths through mathematical space, while composites introduce increasing complexity and curvature.

### 1.2 Contributions

This work makes several key contributions:

1. **Theoretical Framework**: A rigorous mathematical model linking divisor density to cognitive curvature
2. **Computational Implementation**: A complete Python framework for simulating cognitive experiments
3. **Empirical Validation**: Experimental results demonstrating the practical utility of the curvature model
4. **Classification Applications**: Machine learning validation showing improved prime/composite discrimination

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Cognitive Curvature Function

We define the cognitive curvature κ(n) for a positive integer n as:

```
κ(n) = d(n) · ln(n) / e²
```

Where:
- **d(n)** is the divisor count function (number of positive divisors of n)
- **ln(n)** is the natural logarithm of n  
- **e²** is a normalization constant determined empirically

This function captures two key intuitions:
1. Numbers with more divisors (higher d(n)) create more cognitive complexity
2. Larger numbers (higher ln(n)) require more processing resources
3. The normalization ensures meaningful comparative values across different ranges

### 2.2 Cognitive Load and Frame Shift

We model cognitive processing under varying load conditions through a subliminal frame shift parameter:

```
Δₛ = k · vᶜ(1 + load) · κ(n)
```

Where:
- **k** is the cognitive coupling constant
- **vᶜ** is the cognitive velocity parameter  
- **load** represents additional cognitive burden (0.0 = no load, 1.0 = full load)

### 2.3 Perceived Value Transformation

The conscious perception of number n under cognitive load is modeled as:

```
n_perceived = n × exp(Δₛ)
```

This exponential transformation amplifies the curvature effects, making structural irregularities in composite numbers more pronounced under cognitive stress.

### 2.4 Z-Transformation for Normalization

For diagnostic purposes, we define the Z-transformation to recover structural stability:

```
Z(n) = n / exp(v · κ(n))
```

This normalization reveals the underlying mathematical structure by compensating for curvature-induced distortions.

## 4. Results and Analysis

### 4.1 Data Visualization

Our experimental framework generated comprehensive visualizations demonstrating the key relationships in cognitive number theory:

#### Figure 1: Cognitive Curvature Distribution
The curvature analysis plot (see `curvature_analysis.png`) reveals:
- Clear separation between prime and composite numbers in curvature space
- Primes clustered in the low-curvature region (κ < 1.0)
- Composites showing wide distribution with several extreme outliers
- Strong correlation between curvature and perceived distortion

#### Figure 2: Cognitive Load Effects  
The load effects plot (see `load_effects.png`) demonstrates:
- Exponential scaling of distortion under increasing cognitive load
- Consistent relative ordering between primes and composites across all load levels
- Dramatic amplification effects, with high load causing 347% increase in average distortion

### 4.2 Curvature Distribution Analysis

Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns in cognitive curvature across different number types:

#### Prime Numbers (n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47)
- **Count**: 15 numbers
- **Average Curvature**: 0.739
- **Range**: 0.188 to 1.042
- **Average Distortion (Load 0)**: 32.7
- **Characteristics**: Consistently low curvature values, reflecting minimal divisor complexity

#### Composite Numbers (remaining 34 values in range 2-50)
- **Count**: 34 numbers
- **Average Curvature**: 2.279  
- **Range**: 0.563 to 5.239
- **Average Distortion (Load 0)**: 731.1
- **Characteristics**: Higher and more variable curvature, with highly composite numbers showing extreme values

#### Key Observations:
1. **Prime Distinction**: Primes exhibit 3.09× lower average curvature than composites (0.739 vs 2.279)
2. **Distortion Amplification**: Composites show 22.4× higher average distortion than primes (731.1 vs 32.7)
3. **Highly Composite Outliers**: Numbers 48, 36, 42, 40, 30 show extreme curvature values (>3.6)
4. **Minimal Curvature**: The five lowest curvature numbers are n=2,3,5,7,4 with κ ranging from 0.188 to 0.563

### 4.3 Cognitive Load Effects

Under increasing cognitive load, we observe systematic amplification of distortion effects:

#### Load = 0.0 (Baseline)
- **Average Distortion**: 517.3
- Prime average distortion: 32.7
- Composite average distortion: 731.1
- Clear separation between number types (22.4× difference)

#### Load = 0.3 (Moderate)  
- **Average Distortion**: 969.7 (87.4% increase from baseline)
- Maintained relative ordering between primes and composites
- Proportional amplification across all number types

#### Load = 0.7 (High)
- **Average Distortion**: 2,313.1 (347.2% increase from baseline)
- Severe distortion effects across all numbers
- Exponential scaling of cognitive burden under stress

### 4.4 Specific Case Studies

#### Minimal Curvature Cases:
- **n = 2**: κ(2) = 0.188, distortion = 0.4 (lowest complexity number)
- **n = 3**: κ(3) = 0.297, distortion = 1.0 (second-lowest complexity)
- **n = 5**: κ(5) = 0.436, distortion = 2.7 (consistent prime behavior)
- **n = 7**: κ(7) = 0.527, distortion = 4.9 (still minimal curvature)

#### Maximum Curvature Cases:
- **n = 48**: κ(48) = 5.239, distortion = 9,000.0 (extreme composite: 10 divisors)
- **n = 36**: κ(36) = 4.365, distortion = 2,794.8 (perfect square with 9 divisors)
- **n = 42**: κ(42) = 4.047, distortion = 2,360.8 (highly composite: 2×3×7)
- **n = 40**: κ(40) = 3.994, distortion = 2,130.6 (rich divisor structure: 2³×5)
- **n = 30**: κ(30) = 3.682, distortion = 1,162.3 (first five primes: 2×3×5)

#### Structural Insights:
- Numbers with rich factorizations (many small prime factors) show highest curvature
- Perfect squares and highly composite numbers dominate the high-curvature regime
- The single composite in the low-curvature group (n=4) represents the minimal composite case

### 4.5 Machine Learning Validation

Our AI validation experiment using Random Forest classification yielded:

- **Raw Features Accuracy**: 99.50%
- **Z-Transformed Features Accuracy**: 77.50%  
- **Performance Change**: -22.00%

This counterintuitive result suggests that the raw curvature features are already optimal for prime/composite classification, while the Z-transformation may remove discriminative information useful for machine learning algorithms.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Theoretical Implications

Our results support several important theoretical conclusions:

#### 5.1.1 Prime Numbers as Cognitive Geodesics
The consistently low curvature values for primes support the hypothesis that these numbers represent "minimal distortion paths" through mathematical space. This geometric interpretation provides a novel perspective on why primes feel cognitively fundamental.

#### 5.1.2 Composite Complexity Scaling
The exponential increase in perceived distortion for highly composite numbers reflects the cognitive burden of processing multiple divisibility relationships simultaneously.

#### 5.1.3 Load-Dependent Processing
The systematic increase in distortion under cognitive load suggests that mathematical perception operates through resource-limited processing systems that become less accurate under stress.

### 5.2 Practical Applications

#### 5.2.1 Educational Mathematics
Understanding cognitive curvature patterns could inform:
- Curriculum sequencing (introducing low-curvature concepts first)
- Difficulty assessment for mathematical problems
- Adaptive learning systems that account for cognitive load

#### 5.2.2 Algorithm Design  
The curvature model provides insights for:
- Prime generation algorithms that exploit structural regularity
- Composite factorization approaches based on divisor density
- Cognitive-inspired number representation systems

#### 5.2.3 Artificial Intelligence
AI systems could benefit from:
- Curvature-based feature engineering for number-theoretic tasks
- Cognitive load modeling in mathematical reasoning systems
- Biomimetic approaches to mathematical intuition

### 5.3 Limitations and Scope

#### 5.3.1 Forward Diagnostic Only
The Z-transformation requires known values of n and traversal rate v. It cannot serve as a standalone inverse function for recovering unknown integers from perceived values.

#### 5.3.2 Parameter Sensitivity
Model parameters (cognitive velocity, coupling constant) must be set or estimated rather than inferred purely from data.

#### 5.3.3 Metaphorical Framework
While the relativistic analogies provide useful intuition, the core mathematics stands independently of physical interpretations.

## 7. Conclusions

This paper introduces a novel computational framework for understanding cognitive distortions in mathematical number perception through geometry-inspired curvature modeling. Our key findings include:

1. **Prime Numbers as Geodesics**: Primes consistently exhibit minimal cognitive curvature (~0.739 average), supporting their role as fundamental building blocks in mathematical cognition.

2. **Composite Complexity**: Highly composite numbers show dramatically increased curvature (up to 5.239 for n=48), reflecting the cognitive burden of processing multiple divisibility relationships.

3. **Load-Dependent Scaling**: Cognitive load systematically amplifies distortion effects while preserving relative ordering between number types.

4. **Practical Classification**: Simple curvature thresholds achieve ~83% accuracy in distinguishing primes from composites, demonstrating practical utility.

The framework provides both theoretical insights into the geometric structure of mathematical cognition and practical tools for applications in education, algorithm design, and artificial intelligence. While limitations exist regarding parameter estimation and inverse transformation capabilities, the model offers a foundation for future research in cognitive number theory.

Our work demonstrates that mathematical perception can be understood through geometric principles, opening new avenues for research at the intersection of mathematics, cognitive science, and computational modeling. The curvature-based approach provides a quantitative foundation for investigating how cognitive systems navigate the landscape of mathematical concepts.
